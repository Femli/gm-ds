What is the mean (total) pledge that projects get? (not per backer)
>4980.75

Create a histogram that shows the distribution for number of backers. What is the skew of the distribution?
>It is extremely skewed to the right
>> this tells us that an overwhelming amount of projects have a smaller amount of backers

Is the ‘duration’ variable normally distributed?
> No
>>(assuming durations is day units) this tells us that a majority of projects last less than 50 days

If you could collect data on another attribute of these projects, what would it be and why?
> It would be interesting to see the income brackets of project backers, 
or what financial entities the backers belong to (individual, corporate, charity, etc.).
This may help us understand the success ratio of "grass roots" projects vs "elite-backed" projects


Create a presentation using Google Slides (max. 5 slides) using the data above
(and additional data from those tables) that make clear recommendations on how people can 
create a successful Kickstarter campaign.
Be sure to consider the following:
 - What's the best length of time to run a campaign?
 > the median successful campaign is about 38 days long, with half of the successful campaigns 
   falling between 30 - 45 mins.
 >> In general, its best to keep a campaign under 45 days, with 75% of successful campaigns falling
     under that timeframe
 - What's the ideal pledge goal?
 > About 75% of successful projects fall under 7255 pledged funds, with the most popular pledged being 1000

 - What type of projects would be most successful at getting funded?
 > The top two project categories are Music and Film/Video, which make the majority of successful projects

 - Is there an ideal month/day/time to launch a campaign
 > The top fundraising dates are May, Apr, Mar, and Feb; these months fall within the spring season.
Peak fundraising month is May (late spring).
